# Project Proposal

The goal of this project will be to create a functioning website dedicated to a Minecraft server. Members will be able to join the server through the website, access server announcements, communicate with each other (forums, messaging, etc.), and buy various products (both virtual and physical) to help support the server. This website will be accessible to anyone interested in the Minecraft game, although it will mainly target gamers and Minecraft enthusiasts. Owners of the website will be able to manage members of the server, sell various products, make announcements as well as view and modify information about their website and server.

Here are the features planned for the website, with different permissions and features based on whether you are an owner or a user/client:

## As a user/client:

- You will be able to sign up for the server, register to become a member of the server, login and log out (all user data will be stored on a database)
- You will require 2-factor authentication
- You can communicate with other players on the website
- You can view videos that were made or post your own
- You can &quot;purchase&quot; items on the website to help support the server
- You can purchase VIP privileges for discounts and features in the server
- You can view your buy history
- You can view the specials
- You can check your order
- You can add or remove items from cart
- You can search product catalog
- You can apply discounts on your purchases based on your privileges/privilege level
- You can track shipping when buying physical objects
- You can change your information (email, telephone number, etc.)
- You can open/create a ticket (ask for tech support, report a bug, etc.)

## As the owner:

- You can view user information (membership status, login time, purchases, etc.)
- You can delete and add users
- You can ban users temporarily or permanently
- You can add, delete, update and view products in the catalog
- You can remove videos of users
- You can communicate with users
- You can verify the state of the website
- You can display website info messages (on the main page for example)
- You can view information about finances, such as total revenue/profit, sales revenue by product category (virtual, physical, memberships, VIP privileges, etc.), loss (such as from refunds)
- You can view transactions that are completed and in progress
- You can view and answer user tickets

\*We will complete our 30 features as the project progresses. Features may be subject to changes as the development of the website advances. More features (apart of the 30 required) may be added depending on time constraints and complexity.

We will model our project on other available Minecraft servers and use them as guidelines. The timeline of the project will be of about 15 weeks, spanning from the beginning of the semester to the end, so we estimate that we will spend a total of 135 hours building this product, i.e., 30 hours per team member. Since this is a school project, there is no budget defined as hours worked are unpaid.
