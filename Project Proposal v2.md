We estimate that we will spend a total of 135 hours building this product, i.e., 30 hours per team member. Since this is a school project, there is no budget defined as hours worked are unpaid.

We will model our project on other jewelry websites and use them as guidelines, such as [https://mejuri.com/](https://mejuri.com/) .
